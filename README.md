# About Program
A simple To Do List program that implements basic and object-oriented programming with PHP that can keep a list of things the user must do, so that this program can make it easier for users to stay productive and sensitive to what needs to be done.

<ul>
  <li>Display a simple menu that is easy to use on the terminal and contains the latest todo data</li>
  <li>Added things to do</li>
  <li>Delete what has already been done</li>
</ul>

The program has not been integrated with any database because this program just my practice in learning the basic of PHP. Hopefully, this todolist program can develop and increase its features even better.
