# About Program
Simple To-Do List program that implements basic and object-oriented programming with PHP. This program can make it easier for users to stay productive and sensitive to what needs to be done because that can keep a list of things the user must do.

<ul>
  <li>Display a simple menu that is easy to use on the terminal and contains the latest to-do data</li>
  <li>Added things to-do</li>
  <li>Delete what has already been done</li>
</ul>

The program has not been integrated with any database because this program is just practice in learning the basics of PHP. Hopefully, this to-do list program can develop and increase its features even better.
